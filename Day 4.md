#  **Customizing Fonts:** 📚

![How to Space Elements in Bootstrap 4 Without Custom Classes | by Ilona D. |  Better Programming](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1000/1*uNHm1Ex-t28793ta0dEDpA.jpeg)
Custom fonts can give your Bootstrap projects a unique and branded appearance, making them stand out from the crowd. Bootstrap allows you to incorporate custom fonts easily. Here's how to do it:

1.  **Using Google Fonts** 🌐:
    
    -   Google Fonts offers a vast library of free web fonts. To use a Google Font in your Bootstrap project, include the font link in your HTML file's `<head>` section.
``` html
<!-- Add the Google Font link -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans">
```
2. **Applying Custom Fonts** 🔤:

-   Once you've added the font link, you can apply the custom font to specific elements using CSS. For example, to apply the "Open Sans" font to a paragraph, you would do:
``` html
<style>
  p {
    font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;
  }
</style>
```

3. **Fallback Fonts** 📜:

-   It's a good practice to specify fallback fonts in case the custom font fails to load. This ensures that your text remains readable even if the custom font is unavailable.
``` html
p {
  font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; /* Fallback to a sans-serif font */
}
```

4. **Font Weight and Style** 💼:

-   You can also customize the font weight and style, making use of font properties like `font-weight` and `font-style`.
``` html
p {
  font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;
  font-weight: bold;
  font-style: italic;
}
```

5. **Font Size and Line Height** 📏:

-   Adjust font size and line height as needed to match your design.
``` html
p {
  font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;
  font-size: 16px;
  line-height: 1.5;
}
```

6. **Responsive Typography** 📱:

-   Consider making your custom font responsive by using media queries to adjust font sizes for different screen sizes.
``` html
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  p {
    font-size: 14px;
  }
}
```

By incorporating custom fonts into your Bootstrap projects, you can achieve a distinct and branded look that aligns with your design goals. Custom fonts add a unique touch to your website's typography, making it more appealing to visitors. 🚀

### **Objective:** 
Create a webpage that incorporates Bootstrap components, forms, and modals to enhance user interaction.

### **Instructions:**

**1.  Start by creating an HTML file and include the necessary Bootstrap and jQuery links in the `<head>` section. Don't forget to add emojis to make it exciting! 🌟**
``` html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Bootstrap Components Activity</title>
    <!-- Add Bootstrap CSS link here -->

    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.5.2/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
```

**2. Create a navigation bar with the following features:**

-   Emphasize the brand with a unique name and an emoji.
-   Include a dropdown menu with at least two menu items.
-   Add a button that triggers a modal when clicked.
``` html
<nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-light bg-light">

        <!-- Brand with emoji -->
        <a class="navbar-brand" href="#">MyWebsite 🚀</a>
        <!-- Dropdown menu -->
        <button class="navbar-toggler" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#navbarNav"
            aria-controls="navbarNav" aria-expanded="false" aria-label="Toggle navigation">
            <span class="navbar-toggler-icon"></span>
        </button>
        <div class="collapse navbar-collapse" id="navbarNav">
            <ul class="navbar-nav ml-auto">
                <li class="nav-item dropdown">
                    <a class="nav-link dropdown-toggle" href="#" id="navbarDropdown" role="button"
                        data-toggle="dropdown" aria-haspopup="true" aria-expanded="false">
                        Dropdown
                    </a>
                    <div class="dropdown-menu" aria-labelledby="navbarDropdown">
                        <a class="dropdown-item" href="#">Action</a>
                        <a class="dropdown-item" href="#">Another action</a>
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li class="nav-item">
                    <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#myModal">
                        Open Modal
                    </button>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>
</nav>
```

**3. Create a Bootstrap modal with a form inside it. The form should have at least two input fields, a submit button, and emojis for labels.**
``` html
<!-- Modal -->
<div class="modal fade" id="myModal" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-labelledby="exampleModalLabel"
    aria-hidden="true">
    <div class="modal-dialog" role="document">
        <div class="modal-content">
            <div class="modal-header">
                <h5 class="modal-title" id="exampleModalLabel">Contact Us 📧</h5>
                <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-label="Close">
                    <span aria-hidden="true">&times;</span>
                </button>
            </div>
            <div class="modal-body">
                <form>
                    <div class="form-group">
                        <label for="name">Name 👤</label>
                        <input type="text" class="form-control" id="name" placeholder="Enter your name">
                    </div>
                    <div class="form-group">
                        <label for="email">Email 📧</label>
                        <input type="email" class="form-control" id="email" placeholder="Enter your email">
                    </div>
                    <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Submit</button>
                </form>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

**4.  Finally, test your webpage. When you click the button in the navigation bar, it should open the modal with the form. Complete the form and submit it.**
